Most of my projects are client work and under NDA. If I have free time, I hack on random things

* [JiraTabs][7] – I have a particular Jira workflow when I’m triaging and assigning to team members. This bookmarklet lets me open every Jira in view in a new tab to power through them faster
* [DoneCancelNumberPadToolbar][8] –&nbsp;Adds Done and Cancel buttons to an iPhone Number Pad. Was my first experience adding to [CocoaPods][9]
* [JsonEndpoint][10] – We needed fast and dirty JSON mocking for a project at work. Apiary didn't exist yet, so I rolled a quick one
* [Magento Callstack][11] – A helper extension to aid in debugging [Magento][12]
* [PythonistaTrello][13] –&nbsp;Used to add cards to Trello using [Launch Center Pro][14] and [Pythonista][15].&nbsp;Tutorial [here][16]
* [Dot files][17] – My config for oh-my-zsh.
* [casey.coffee][18] – Quick fun site I threw together for [Casey Liss][19] and to try deploying static or php to Heroku
* [Inbox Zero Macros][20] – The macros for both windows and Mac that help me keep Inbox Zero
* [JsonLint for Alfred][21] – Part of how [I&nbsp;Format JSON and save to gist with Alfred][22]
* [django-solr-demo][23] – An [introduction][24] to using Solr with django
* [django-admin-remainingcharacters][25] – Django package to show the remaining characters on a field in the admin
* [django-admin-preview][26] –&nbsp;Django package to enable inline template previews of a model in a list view in the admin
* [broder.us][27] – A fun little website I threw together for my wedding

Launched Side Projects that are now deceased:

* Twitter2Gtalk – I started this at an AppEngine hackathon the Google hosted years ago. It ran until I hit my limit on the free tier (about 10,000 users). I shudder to look at the [code][28] to this.
* SimpleWod – I started a site to keep track of workouts I was doing. I had about 20 friends beta testing it. Then Beyond The Whiteboard came out and it was doing everything we would need
* ReaderFollow – When Google removed comments from Google Reader, I built this to hold the comments. I had a pretty hardcore group of Reader friends. It was a combination of a Greasmonkey script and a Django backend that let my friends and I continue to comment. It had about 500 users when Google shut down reader entirely. I thought about building a full RSS service. But seeing what [FeedBin][29] was doing got me excited about that.
* [Beyond The Whiteboard 2 RSS][30]&nbsp;– Used to create an RSS feed from your workout entries on&nbsp;<https: beyondthewhiteboard.com="">&nbsp;on AppEngine.
* Took it down after the BTWB redesign. I had a few hundred users for fun.
