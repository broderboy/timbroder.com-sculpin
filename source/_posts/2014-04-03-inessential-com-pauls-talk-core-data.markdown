> it’s more that I’m eternally on the fence about Core Data.

Brent Simmons goes into a few examples on the mind games you have to play when
thinking about Core Data scenarios. We are all pretty wired for relational
thinking. More recently we've learned to think more TKTK. Core Data and it's
object graph is yet another way of thinking

I'm learning Core Data as part of my next app and am enjoying it so far.
Eventually I'll be tackling sync. I need to see for myself how bad Coe Data
sync is. I've had some exposure to FMDB by tinkering with Marco Arment's
FCOfflineQueue in the same app.
