[Google Calendar API](http://googledataapis.blogspot.com/2007/07/create-calendars-with-google-calendar.html) posts new read and write features. They
have added:  
  
* [owncalendars](http://code.google.com/apis/calendar/developers_guide_protocol.html#ManagingCalendars): contains the collection of calendars that a user 'owns'  
* [allcalendars](http://code.google.com/apis/calendar/developers_guide_protocol.html#ManagingSubscriptions): contains all the calendars that a user has access to  
  
Useful for listing all your calendars if you manage a lot of them, or
changing their settings all at once (both features have read and write
capabilities)
