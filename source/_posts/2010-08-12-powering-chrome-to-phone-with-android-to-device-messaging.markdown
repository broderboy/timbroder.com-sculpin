Android [Cloud to Device Messaging
(C2DM)](http://code.google.com/android/c2dm/) was launched recently as part of
Android 2.2. C2DM enables third-party developers to push lightweight data
messages to the phone. C2DM created a nice opportunity for us to pull together
different Google developer tools to create a simple but useful application to
enable users to push links and other information from their desktop / laptop
to their phone. The result was Chrome to Phone - a [20-percent
time](http://www.google.com/intl/en/jobs/lifeatgoogle/englife/) project at
Google. [Chrome to Phone](http://chrome.blogspot.com/) comprises a Chrome
Extension, an Android Application, and a Google AppEngine server. All of the
code is open sourced and serves as a nice example of how to use C2DM. I really
can't wait for the 2.2 update to my phone. Check out the technical brief
