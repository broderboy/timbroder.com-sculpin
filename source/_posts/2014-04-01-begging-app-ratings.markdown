> John Gruber recently suggested that users who are annoyed by “Please Rate
This App” panes should leave one-star reviews. We have a “contact us” menu
item under our Help menu, but if users decide to post reviews instead, we
cannot provide any tech support. So we also can’t tell the other four people
that their crashers should be fixed now, and they should update to the version
on our website (or wait for the App Store approval). Apple’s customers are
Apple’s customers, except we’re supposed to support them, but we aren’t
provided the tools by Apple to do so.
