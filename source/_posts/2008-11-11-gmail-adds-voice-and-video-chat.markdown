The [plugin](http://mail.google.com/videochat?hl=en) isn't out for Linux so I
can't test it out just yet. Hopefully I'll be able to try it out on
[Laura's](http://maybe-not.net/) mac later.  Until then, more info is
available [here](http://mashable.com/2008/11/11/gmail-video-voice-chat/).  If
you've tried it out, let me [know](http://www.twitter.com/broderboy/).
