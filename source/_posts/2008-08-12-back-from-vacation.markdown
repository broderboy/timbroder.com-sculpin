I did as much relaxing as I could on Vacation down at the Jersey Shore. No
computers at all. Just me, the beach and a bunch of books. Went on the Human
Sling shot (spring shot?) which was a lot of fun, see the video and pictures
below.  
  
Also, Check out goodreads.com. Its a lot better then any of the other
bookshelving services I've reviewed [in the
past](http://blog.gpowered.net/2007/09/google-books-my-library-vs-
librarything.html). The reasons why will be in a future post in the not so
distant future.
