I did as much relaxing as I could on Vacation down at the Jersey Shore.  No computers at all. Just me, the beach and a bunch of books.  Went on the Human Sling shot (spring shot?) which was a lot of fun, see the video and pictures below.    
  

Also, Check out goodreads.com.  Its a lot better then any of the other bookshelving services I've reviewed [in the past](http://blog.gpowered.net/2007/09/google-books-my-library-vs-librarything.html).  The reasons why will be in a future post in the not so distant future.
