It's been a little more then a week... Chalk it up to quite a bit of
traveling. I'm around now until December, I promise ;)  
  
**This weeks winner: [Mappington](http://www.mappington.com)  
** API's used: 

  * [Eventful](http://api.eventful.com/)

  * [GeoNames](http://www.geonames.org/export/)
  * [Google Maps](http://www.google.com/apis/maps/)

  * [Yahoo Travel](http://developer.yahoo.com/travel/)
  * [YouTube](http://code.google.com/apis/youtube/overview.html)
Why it won: Mappington is the most inclusive map / location information hub I
have ever come across. "Mappington is a user created atlas of the world." It
covers the following:  

  * Maps: Google Maps, Virtual Earth, Yahoo Maps, Google Earth
  * Photos: Flickr
  * Videos: Youtube
  * Wikipedia Entries
  * Opinions / Rating section
  * Social Web on Wikipedia, Facebook, del.icio.us, furl, Yahoo MyWeb, Wink, ma.gnolia, spurl
  * Discussions
  * History
  * News: Yahoo News
  * Blog: Google Blog Search, Technorati
  * Hotels
  * Flights
  * Weather: Weatherbug
  * Events: e:vene
  * Trips: Yahoo Travel
  
The layout is crisp, clean, and easy on the eyes. There are minimal load times
and Mappington makes good use of Ajax. If you are planning a trip or just want
to explore new places, Mappington is the best place to do it. I'm definitely
going to use it to plan out my trip to Ireland in a few months.  
  
What I think it could improve on:

  * The video's don't show that you can click on them (mouse pointer does not change)
  * The photos should tap into Picasa Web also
  * In the News section, it looked like there was supposed to be a left frame (Google News maybe?) but it never loaded
  * I wish you could blow the map up full screen
  * The thumbnail view in Google Maps wasn't working
  * Mappington should build some widgets / gadgets to get more exposure on personal web pages and sites like myspace
  
  
**Runner Ups**  
  
[Wind Surfing Clips](http://www.windsurfingclips.com/)  

  * API's: youtube
  * Clean interface
  * For such exciting and energetic video's, the template is pretty bland
  * I'd like a link to the original video on youtube
  
  
[Baby Name Map](http://www.babynamemap.com/)  

  * API's: Google Maps
  * Very fitting interface
  * Maps are slow
  * The Javascript pop-up UI feels very out of place compared to the site's theme
  
  
[My Next Dive](http://www.mynextdive.com/)  

  * API's: Google Maps
  * The popup on the main page won't go away
  
  
[My Map Chat](http://www.mymapchat.com/)  

  * API's: Google Maps
  * Global shout outs are very entertaining
  
  
[Zoogle](http://www.zoogle.in/)  

  * API's: Amazon eCommerce, CNET, del.icio.us, Digg, eBay, Flickr, Google Search, Windows Live Search, Yahoo Search, YouTube
  * The search box doesn't understand spaces?!? Ex: I put in "Tim Broder" it returned nothing and asked me if I meant "Tim+Broder" which returned some results that I expected
  
  
[Croatia-Map.net](http://www.croatia-map.net/)

  * API's: Google Maps
  * Very smooth, clean, well done
