These are just a few highlights from while I was gone...  
  
[Google](http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2007/09/our-plans-for-code-jam.html)
Starts talking about a possible coding competition and gives some practice
problems. Maybe I'll take a crack at them on the train on Friday...  
  
[Google Mashup Editor](http://googlemashupeditor.blogspot.com/2007/08/more-new-stuff-831-feature-release.html) had a feature release. Check out the post
for the full list but my favorite new features include:  
* Ability to edit XML, CSS and HTML files uploaded into the editor.  
* New Tab styling and custom placement of tabs via CSS  
* Documentation for new features  
  
[Blogoscoped](http://blogoscoped.com/archive/2007-08-30-n76.html) reported
that iGoogle now has gadget to gadget communication. I think this will lead to
the design of whole tabs with smaller more placeable gadgets that talk to each
other rather then bigger uglier (possibly sluggish?) gadgets.  
  
[Jessen Oller](http://jessenoller.com/2007/08/31/python-30-alpha-1-released-you-want-it-because-its-cool/trackback/): "Python 3.0 Alpha 1 released: You
want it because itâ€™s cool." Mmmmmmmmmm python. Get it
[here](http://python.org/download/releases/3.0/)  
  
[GWT](http://google-code-updates.blogspot.com/2007/08/google-web-toolkit-out-of-beta-as-of-14.html) 1.4 came out of beta  
  
[Google Gears](http://gearsblog.blogspot.com/2007/08/google-gears-02-developer-release-ready.html) 0.2 developer release ready for download. New
features include:  
* Crosss-origin API support  
* HttpRequest and Timer modules (can be used as workers)  
  
[Blogoscoped](http://blogoscoped.com/archive/2007-09-03-n45.html) reported
that there are now new layout options on iGoogle. [Check it
out](http://www.google.com/ig)  
  
[Google Spreadsheets](http://google-d-s.blogspot.com/2007/09/lazy-wednesday.html) got autocomplete. Its pretty nifty. It even understands Sun,
Mon, and then what should come next, same for months and others.
