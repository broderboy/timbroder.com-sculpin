I was adding on an app to a Django project at work where I was overriding an
existing template but did not have access to the view that called that
template. I was left in a scenario where I had the variables that the view was
originally set up with, but non of the new models that I had added.  
  
In a filter you can do whatever logic you want, and then pass information back
to the view. Please keep in mind, this is probably a horrible practice, but it
does have its uses. In this specific scenario I needed to query the new models
without modifying the existing view, solution: add a filter and do the
querying there.  
  
This is the filter that I used to do the querying:  

```python
from django import template
from stager.jira.models import JiraProject, ProjectLink
from stager.staging.models import *
 
register = template.Library()
 
def has_jira(value, arg):
    client = Client.objects.get(path=value)
    project = client.projects.get(path=arg)
    try:
        jiras = ProjectLink.objects.get(ClientProject=project).JiraProject.exclude(filter_id='')
        return True
    except:
        return False
register.filter('has_jira', has_jira)
- See more at: http://timbroder.com/2009/12/sneak-some-advanced-logic-into-django.html#sthash.Ouwjii4C.dpuf
```
Then, in my template:

```HTML
{% load has_jira %}
{% if client.path|has_jira:project.path %}
     <li><a href="jira/projects" >Jira</a></li>
{% endif %}
```
A more general example if this would be to work around the annoyance of not being able to have multiple tests in an if statement in a template: You canâ€™t do {% if this and that %}

A solution would be:

```python
def if_and(value, arg):
    if value and arg:
        return True
    else:
        return False
    
def if_or(value, arg):
    if value or arg:
        return True
    else:
        return False
```


```HTML
{% if True|if_and:False %}
show
{% else %}
don't show
{% endif %}
```

Let me know your thoughts, pros/cons of this method.
