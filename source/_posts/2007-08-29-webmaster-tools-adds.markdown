You can now register domains in [Webmaster
Central](http://www.google.com/webmasters/) with non-English characters in
them by supporting IDNA (Internationalizing Domain Names in Applications).
Originally only domains with a-z, A-Z, 0-9, or '-' could be used. I tested it
out and it looks like its working good!
