Google Instant is a new search enhancement that shows results as you type. We are             pushing the limits of our technology and infrastructure to help you get better search             results, faster. Our key technical insight was that people type slowly, but read             quickly, typically taking 300 milliseconds between keystrokes, but only 30 milliseconds             (a tenth of the time!) to glance at another part of the page. This means that you can             scan a results page while you type.

The most obvious change is that you get to the right content much faster than before             because you don’t have to finish typing your full search term, or even press “search.”             Another shift is that seeing results as you type helps you formulate a better search             term by providing instant feedback. You can now adapt your search on the fly until the             results match exactly what you want. In time, we may wonder how search ever worked in             any other way.



## Benefits


**Faster Searches:** By predicting your search and showing results before             you finish typing, Google Instant can save 2-5 seconds per search.

**Smarter Predictions:** Even when you don’t know exactly what you’re             looking for, predictions help guide your search. The top prediction is shown in grey             text directly in the search box, so you can stop typing as soon as you see what you             need.

**Instant Results:** Start typing and results appear right before your             eyes. Until now, you had to type a full search term, hit return, and hope for the right             results. Now results appear instantly as you type, helping you see where you’re headed,             every step of the way.
