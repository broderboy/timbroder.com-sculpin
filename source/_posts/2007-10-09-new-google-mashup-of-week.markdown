So I've decided to add a new feature to gPowered, the Google Mashup of the
week. So many of these get created all the time using various Google APIs and
services. Each week I'm going to search around find a dozen or so of the
newest ones, pick out the one I like the best and why... with a possible
runner up. As for when I'll be doing these, the new mashups will be posted
sometime in between Saturday and Monday. Usually on the weekend unless I'm
going away... like next weekend (Tennessee).... and the weekend after that
(Boston)...  
  
... and the Mashup of the Week goes to:  
  
[Jolocate](http://www.jolocate.com/Listings.aspx)  
APIs: [Google Maps](http://www.google.com/apis/maps/),
[Craigslist](www.craigslist.org)  
The Good: Its craigslist... with a map. Or I should say its a map with
Craiglist in it. If you've ever gone apartment hunting, you know the value of
this. Smooth, no lag when changing grids, Craiglist opens right in the same
window. I also really like the account feature. The site tries to profile you
for people looking for roommates, and also from what I gather, is going to
email me suggestions when I need to start looking for a place for a July 1
move-in.  
The Bad: Not necessarily bad, but I would have liked the option to have
Craigslist open in a new window  
The Ugly: New York wasn't in the default list!  
  
Other contestants:  
  
[Spell Boy Beta](http://www.google.com/ig/directory?hl=en&url=http://www.sends
ome.org/spellboy/modules/google_gadget/index.xml)  
APIs: [Google Gadgets](www.google.com/apis/gadgets/)  
Why it didn't make it: For on the web FireFox or Google toolbar can spell
check all the forms for you, and if you're mail client can't spellcheck...
well.. get a new one.  
  
<http://www.careersix.com/>  
APIs: [Google Maps](http://www.google.com/apis/maps/),
[Indeed](http://www.indeed.com/jsp/apiinfo.jsp)  
Why it didn't make it: The website was VERY slow to load the first time, I
almost stopped looking at it because I thought it was down. Also I didn't see
any place to search by job? only by location and then I have to hit ctrl+F?  
  
[Checker-forum.de](http://www.checker-forum.de/wbblite/portal.php)  
Small community that uses the Youtube API to show off and comment on videos in
users profiles.  
APIs: [Youtube](www.youtube.com/dev )  
Why it didn't make it: I don't speak German  
  
[100 Mile Diet](http://100milediet.org/map/)  
APIs: [Google Maps](http://www.google.com/apis/maps/)  
"When the average North American sits down to eat, each ingredient has
typically traveled at least 1,500 miles. Use this interactive map and the
100-Mile Diet book to eat local, think global."  
  
[FormSpring + Google Calendar](http://www.formspring.com/blog/2007/09/07/using-google-calendar-with-the-formspring-api/)  
APIs: [Google
Calendar](code.google.com/apis/calendar/developers_guide_protocol.html),
formspring  
Why it didn't make it: Formspring costs money for anything worthwhile, free
gives u 3 forms and 50 saves per form?
