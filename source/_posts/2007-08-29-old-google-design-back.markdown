[Blogoscoped](http://blogoscoped.com/archive/2007-08-27.html#n55) reports that some people have the old design (Google App
links are above the search bar instead of the upper left).  I checked at
work on IE6 and firefox and at home on firefox (on Gutsy) and IE7 both logged in
and logged out but still had the new interface.  I wonder who has the
old one...
