> If an organized hacker ring sabotaged security standards and major tech
infrastructure for years, compromising the security of hundreds of millions of
people and many governments including our own (and potentially causing
billions of dollars in damages when these exploits were found by others), and
exploited any flaws they found or created to spy on millions of people in the
world including our own citizens, what should they be charged with?     Mass
criminal sabotage, cybercrime, cyberwarfare, and computer fraud? Obviously.
Terrorism? Maybe, but not quite.     At what point do the NSA’s actions
qualify as treason?     I’d say they’re well past that point.
