Things have changed slightly since I [last](http://blog.gpowered.net/2008/05
/why-microsoft-will-buy-facebook-and.html) wrote about this, but for the
better. Look like Google will be able to trawl some of Facebook [after
all](http://www.insidefacebook.com/2008/09/12/facebook-to-publish-event-
directory-for-search-engines/).  
  
Searchable data will include People, Pages, Applications, Events, and Groups.
