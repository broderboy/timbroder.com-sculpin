A few months ago I gave a presentation at [work](http://www.alexanderinteractive.com/) about why we moved from SVN to distributed source and git. Totally forgot to put it in a post here. I also had a lot of fun playing with [reveal.js](http://broderboy.github.com/git-presentation/) for the slides and setting up [github pages](http://pages.github.com/).

I cover the following:



	
  * What is traditional source control?

	
  * How does distributed differ?

	
  * Why Git?

	
  * Git atÂ [Ai](http://bit.ly/aiwork)


Check out the slides [here](http://broderboy.github.com/git-presentation/)
