4 of my 5 most used Google apps now have offline access through [Gears
](http://gears.google.com/)(Gmail, Docs, and reader being the other).  I use
picasa heavily also but there is way too much data there for gears.  Head over
to your [calendar ](https://www.google.com/calendar/)to add the feature.
