Thank you, [Jerry](http://www.techmusings.me/3/post/2016/12/review-caudabe-the-sheath-for-iphone-7.html "Jerry")

> The Sheath, the case is a svelte .90mm thick, full coverage case. Caudabe calls the material ShockLite, a soft gel-like flexible polymer with shock protection.

The Caudabe Sheath, on my iPhone 7+, is the best case I've ever used. 

I need a case. I drop my phone on a weekly basis and I'm nitpicky. Apple's silicon grips my pocket too much. The leather feels weird when I sweat running. Bumpers are too wide. Other 3rd party cases don't stay on as well

This case nails it all: It feels great in my hand and pocket, its super thin, and so far has survived drop "tests"
