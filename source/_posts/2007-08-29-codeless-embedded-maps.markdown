Google Maps released [Embeddable Maps](http://google-
latlong.blogspot.com/2007/08/youtube-style-embeddable-maps_21.html). It's as
easy as embedding youtube videos. All you have to do is create your map, and
then under the "Link to this page" menu, there is a new option under the link
that has some HTML iframe code to add the map anywhere. Check out the next
post to see the trip to Syracuse I took this weekend to go to the New York
State Fair.
