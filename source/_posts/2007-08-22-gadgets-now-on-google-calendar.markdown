Google Gadgets can now be added to your calendar. Previously the only gadgets
I had on my calendar were Google Doodles, Weather, phases of the moon, and
PicasaWeb Photo of the day. Now just about anything is going to be possible. I
briefly played around with it this morning and added horoscopes and Sudoku to
my calendar.

Other new gadgets include Movie Release dates and famous people's birthdays. I
expect that very soon there will be video game releases as well.
[Documentation](http://code.google.com/apis/calendar/calendar_gadgets.html) is
out for the gadgets, so get coding!
