> _Welcome to the future of killing time on the internet, and getting paid for
it: Digg is implementing a reverse pay wall! We believe this will greatly
enhance the Digg experience. Early reaction from test users has been great.
Can Duruk, developer at Digg, sums it up well:_ _"I thought Rebecca Black's
'Friday' video was great now that I got paid to watch it!"_

Now, I used to be on Digg for at least an hour a day. then v4 came... and it
kind of sucks now..... Losing nested categories was a huge loss for me.

(9:40:46 AM) Laura: Hmm 

(9:41:00 AM) Laura: Digg is so horrible, that's a little like being ok with becoming a
prostitute 

(9:41:03 AM) Laura: I mean, you get paid
