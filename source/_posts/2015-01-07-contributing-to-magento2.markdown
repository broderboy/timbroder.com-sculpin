The Magento2 dev team is now using Github in the traditional sense: They have
an internal repo that gets pushed out to github at the end of their sprint.
All commits stay intact. This is WAY better than the previous method of
pushing a giant commit with everything each sprint.

Ben has a [good walkthrough](http://bhmarks.com/blog/contributing-to-
magento-2/) on submitting a pull request to the repo. He links to a few
resources to get up and running on the new platform.  Alan Kent goes into more
[detail](https://alankent.wordpress.com/2014/12/27/behind-the-recent-magento-2
-github-changes/) on the “why” of the change.

It’s not just code that has been opened up. The
[documentation](https://alankent.wordpress.com/2014/12/20/about-magento-2-0
-developer-documentation/) lives on Github now too.

These are all great changes. The more eyes we have on code the better. Do your
part: [Install](https://github.com/magento/magento2) the Magento 2 developer
preview and get testing
