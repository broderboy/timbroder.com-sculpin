I was stuck in meetings most of the day but I was able to download the keynote for the train ride home :)




Here are some thoughts. If I live tweeted, it probably would have gone something like this. Maybe a few more here..






  * The dev intro video was awesome. It’s like Apple saying “We love you, we’ve heard you”


  * That’s a lot of Apple engineers present




It’s a shame I can’t risk my laptop. I want to play with Yosemite! I dig the new look






  * Ooo dark mode


  * Mail drop is huge for work


  * Airdrop from phone to laptop!!


  * Proximity awareness is great for starting an email on the can and finishing it at the desk ;)


  * Proximity hotspot is PERFECT for when I’m on the train


  * Texts in Messages!!!!!


  * Proximity calls is crazy. Listening to music on laptop with headphones, call comes in, boom.


  * Hmm, maybe I’ll install the public beta…..

  * Interactive notifications, thank god. one of the few things still on my “I miss from Android list”


  * Context typing looks hot. I missed switfkey


  * I’m curious if Health can accurately track my sleep. But, I don’t want my device in bed with me


  * Family sharing and photo stream will be cool :) The purchases is great. Laura and I overlap on so many apps and games


  * I’m really curious what your iCloud size limit is going to be. Unlimited? It can store ALL your photos.  I wonder if people will be dumping photos into this from other services


  * Ah, there we go. Paid tiers. Will probably stick with Flickr for my ultimate backup. (All are also backed up to CrashPlan)


  * Hah, Shazam Siri. Nice




50 mins in the keynote for DEV






  * App store improvements are awesome. The lists, searches, App bundles. Apple LISTENED. wow. Whoa App preview videos


  * Ahh There’s Test Flight! And it’s free


  * Extensibility: Inter-app. boom.


  * Notification Center Widgets. boom


  * 3rd party keyboards. boom


  * Can’t wait for TouchID support in 1password


  * The user implications of HomeKit are nice. We have a WiMo so I’m on board with other home automation things


  * CloudKit. Boom. The cloud pricing wars were already insane. I’m worried about the performance and availability… Code once though…. I


  * The Metal demos are sick. I don’t do much of that type of gaming. Might be time to start again


  * Mentioning Objective-C. OMG


  * Swift. **BOOM. HOLY SHIT**. Closures, Generics, Namespaces




  * OMG the playground


  * Grabbing the book right now. It’s trending. Pretty cool
