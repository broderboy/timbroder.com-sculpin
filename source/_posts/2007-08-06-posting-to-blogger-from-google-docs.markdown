I had seen some posts in the past (like [this one](http://websquirrel.blogspot.com/2006/11/post-google-docs-spreadsheetsto-your.html)) and figured I would give it a try.  The first thing I liked was it feels a lot less cramped then the traditional blogger interface.  Secondly it feels more responsive which for me is pretty good for me as I'm on a 6 year old laptop a lot of the time.  Tagging is a little harder.  You can tag existing tags in blogger but I found it easier to post from Docs & Spreadsheets and then go back into the Blogger interface to tag.  Blogger picks up the post title from the title of the document, but you have to go back in to add the link for the title.  Check it out, it might be better for you then the traditional interface.
