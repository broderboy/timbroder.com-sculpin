> We all want to get better at writing and posting more frequently. As I mentioned in yesterday's post, the best way to improve anything is to do more of it, more often

100% agree. Rebuilding my blog was fun. Let's see if I can get myself to write mode ;)

I'm also trying a "habit app"

> a big part of posting regularly is just having a system that makes it easy

Amen

> Posting to a blog first and then Twitter second seems like a simple idea, but it is extremely powerful. Years from now you end up with an archive of all your short-form writing at your own domain. Not as an afterthought, but as the default.

This is a very interesting idea. It's somewhere in the list for my site rebuild. Somewhere in the middle 

I do really like using buffer though. But I could still go to buffer from IFTTT
