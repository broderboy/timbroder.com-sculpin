Originally I had friendfeed taking care of all my Facebook status updates.  I wasn't sure I liked this on the old profile and was experimenting. Now I definitely want it to go.  But even working with other apps and feeds, I'm not sure the new profile can display what the old one could. These pics are from the new one. Some valuable information is missing from the posts, diggs, twitter isn't even showing up... I'll have to play some more. What do people think?
