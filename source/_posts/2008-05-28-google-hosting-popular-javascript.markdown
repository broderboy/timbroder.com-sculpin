I came across this yesterday looking for the [mootools](http://mootools.net/)
download link. Google is hosting a bunch of the popular javascript libraries
on their server for you.  
  
  
Pros:

  * Use Google's Bandwidth
  * Google takes care of keeping the files up to date
  * Common include code across your apps
  * Use Google as a Fast proxy
  * Gadgets will have access to cached files
  
Cons:

  * Have to rely on Google to keep files up to date
  * Probably won't include beta releases of libraries
  
The main page is [here](http://code.google.com/apis/ajaxlibs/) and currently
includes:

  * [jQuery](http://jquery.com/ )
  * [prototype](http://www.prototypejs.org/)
  * [script.aculo.us](http://script.aculo.us/)
  * [MooTools](http://mootools.net/)
  * [Dojo](http://dojotoolkit.org/)
  
Example jQuery:
