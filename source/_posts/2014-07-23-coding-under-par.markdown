> when it’s midnight and I’m on a perceived roll with some coding challenge,
there doesn’t appear to be any stopping me. I “have all night,” or at least
that’s what my monkey brain says. Of course, the smarter half of me knows I
should be getting calling it a day and getting some much-needed rest.

I hear this. As I get older, and keep to a rigid sleep schedule, I tend to
find myself being useless after 9pm. I do miss the old days io burning through
until 2am. Now that flux exists to take care of the circadian issues, we
should be able to burn all night. Right? RIGHT!?!
