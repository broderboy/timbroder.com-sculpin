# Mini Everything Bagels

*This used to be hosted at [Mommy Mania](http://mommy-mania.com/recipe/keto-diet-friendly-mini-everything-bagels-recipe/ "Mommy Mania") but no longer exists there*

## Ingredients

### Bagels

* 3 Cups Shredded Mozzarella Cheese
* 1/4 Cup Cream Cheese
* 1 teaspoon Xantham Gum
* 1 teaspoon Baking Soda
* 1/2 Cup Almond Flour (Finely ground Almond Meal works too)
* 1/2 teaspoon "lite salt"

### Everything Topping

* 1 teaspoon Garlic Powder
* 1 teaspoon Onion Powder
* 1 teaspoon Poppy Seeds
* 1 teaspoon Sesame Seeds
* 1/2 teaspoon "lite salt"
* 1/4 teaspoon Ground Pepper

## Directions

Preheat oven to 400 degrees and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.

In a small bowl, mix together the almond flour, xantham gum, baking soda, and salt.

In a double boiler or microwave (30 seconds at a time on high), melt cream cheese and mozzarella together and stir until it forms a dough. Let cool slightly.

Knead together the cheese dough and dry ingredients until they are thoroughly and doughy.

Separate into 16 even pieces. Roll each piece into a long log shape and pinch the ends together into a bagel shape. Lay out on your baking sheet.

Mix all of the "everything topping" ingredients together in a small bowl. Brush the bagels liberally with water and sprinkle seasoning over them. Flip over and repeat until all topping is used.

Bake for 10-12 minutes, until they are browned. Watch carefully so they don't burn! Let cool slightly before serving.

Store extras in a sealed container in the refrigerator, reheat in a toaster oven or regular oven for a few minutes.
