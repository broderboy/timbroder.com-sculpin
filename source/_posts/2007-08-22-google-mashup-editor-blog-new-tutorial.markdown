The guys over on the Mashup team have posted a [new tutorial](http://code.goog
le.com/support/bin/answer.py?answer=74728&topic=12044) on how to use the
Google Mashup Editor to mash Picasa Web Albums with a Google Map. The example
is [here](http://levsplaces.googlemashups.com/). I started working on my own
but I haven't really played with the GME before. Hopefully I'll have that
tomorrow.
