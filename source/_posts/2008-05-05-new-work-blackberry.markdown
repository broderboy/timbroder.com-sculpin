Got a new blackberry at work today: The
[8820](http://www.blackberry8800series.com/blackberry8820/). Much nicer then
my old [clunker](http://na.blackberry.com/eng/devices/device-detail.jsp?navId=H0,C63,P65) which... err... broke... yeah we'll go with
broke. Getting the curve when it comes out on Friday for Verizon. I can't
install any applications on my work one, but as soon as I get my personal one,
Google Blackberry app reviews will be pouring out =)
