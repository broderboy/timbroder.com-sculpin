I Added an easier way to go through the posts I'v put on
[blogger](http://gpowered.blogspot.com/) and the
[site](http://gpowered.net/g/). Quick tutorial on it is
[here](http://blog.gpowered.net/2007/08/howto-getting-list-of-post-titles-
from.html).  
  
Also added a [Links](http://gpowered.net/links) section that pull from my
Google Bookmarks. HOWTO is [here](http://blog.gpowered.net/2007/08/howto-
pulling-google-bookmarks-with.html)
