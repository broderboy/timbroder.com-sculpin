Extensions [are coming](http://dev.chromium.org/developers/design-documents/extensions/howto) for chrome.  
  
Google’s Matt Cutts [in a blog post says](http://www.mattcutts.com/blog/write-chrome-extension/): “Extensions currently have very Greasemonkey-like
functionality: you identify which web pages should be modified, plus
JavaScript to be added to those pages. By default, the extension’s JavaScript
runs after the page loads, but you can specify that the extension’s JavaScript
should run before the page loads. Right now, you can only load one JS file,
but that could change in the future. You also can’t currently load Cascading
Style Sheets (CSS), but that might also change.”  
  
Personally, I think they should just port greasemonkey directly so chrome can
take advantage off all the [existing scripts
