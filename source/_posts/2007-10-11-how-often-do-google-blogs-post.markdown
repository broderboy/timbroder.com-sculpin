Google has been using it's blogger platform to deliver news about it's
products and services to the masses. Including the multi-language blogs, there
are about 76 Google blogs out there. But how often do they post? I went
through each one (of the English blogs) and figured out the average number of
posts, per month, that they have for 2007 so far. If a blog wasn't around back
in January, I took that into account also.  
  
The top two are the official Google Blog, and the Google Code blog, which
makes sense as they are all encompassing aspects of Google. Following these
are Maps and Adsense, two of Google biggest products.
