[Google Photos Blog: Ready for our close-
up](http://googlephotos.blogspot.com/2007/09/posted-by-jason-cook-product-
marketing_28.html)  
  
The Picasa team has gotten a blog in the form of the [Google Photos
Blog](http://googlephotos.blogspot.com/). I think this brings the number of
Google blogs to 75 (including the international blogs). On the photo blog they
will be posting feature updates to Picasa, photography tips, and the team's
favorite photo albums.  
  
In addition to working on [Picasa](http://picasa.google.com/) and the [Web
albums features](http://picasaweb.google.com/), they are also in charge of
hosting blogger's [photo upload feature](http://buzz.blogger.com/2007/03
/blogger-and-picasa-web-albums.html), which is powered by Picasa web,
developing Orkut's [photo picker](http://en.blog.orkut.com/2007/08/spice-up-
your-scraps.html), and creating Mapplets for browsing [geotagged photos](http
://google-latlong.blogspot.com/2007/08/posted-by-ping-hsin-chen-software.html)
inside of Google Maps.
