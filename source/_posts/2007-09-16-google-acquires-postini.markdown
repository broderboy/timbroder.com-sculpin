Google has acquired [Postini](http://www.postini.com/index.php) to better
improve Google Apps.  
  
A blurb from Postini's website:  
_With Postini Solutions, you can secure all of your electronic communications
- email, instant messaging and the web â€“ and manage your company's
communication policies from one central location. Postini Solutions can also
make it easy to meet your archiving and encryption needs._  
  
Things I would like to see come out of this:  
\- The ability to encrypt Gmail messages and Google Docs without having to use
greasemonkey  
\- A Google API to encrypt files and transfers in your own application or site  
\- (Ad?) subsidized access to Postini services  
  
The question on the tip of my tongue is, is Postini going to remain a separate
entity though owned by Google, or are its services going to be completely
integrated into Google's services?
