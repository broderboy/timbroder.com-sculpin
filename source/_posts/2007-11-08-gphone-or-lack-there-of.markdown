To be honest, when I heard that Google was going to announce whatever it is
they have been working on with a "gPhone" I was really excited. The
announcement of Android, their new open mobile platform is cool and all, but I
was a little disappointed. Granted thats because might have been expecting
something as cool as the iPhone, or that I desperately need a new phone. I've
been following the [openmoko](http://www.openmoko.com/) project and its going
to be intersting how Android compares to it. For the full Android story, check
