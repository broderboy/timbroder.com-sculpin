> I had a rare Twitter username, @N. Yep, just one letter. Iâ€™ve been offered
as much as $50,000 for it. People have tried to steal it. Password reset
instructions are a regular sight in my e-mail inbox. As of today, I no longer
control @N. I was extorted into giving it up.

Another reason I am quite happy I recently moved all if my domains from
godaddy to hover. (They even took my godaddy login and did it all for me). I'd
like to cancel paypal but I just can't bring myself to do it
