Recently [there](http://jwie.be/launch-center-pro-daily-journaling) have
[been](http://nerdgap.com/launch-center-pro-an-adoption-strategy-for-those-having-trouble-adopting-it/) a [few](http://johnnyrk.com/blog/2014/3/19/updating-updates) Launch Center Pro articles that have recaptured my
attention. I had tried a few months ago to simplify my home screen, no luck.
This time, it's sticking.

A few people have asked me on
twitter what flows I use in LCP so I'm throwing this post together. Please
note my screens are very much a work in progress. There are some Actions in
multiple groups, as well as on the home screen. I also just noticed I'm
missing a browser. A lot of these are app launches instead of true actions.
Working on adding to that so it's more efficient. But, for things like
Instapaper or Pinboard, they detect something in the clipboard on open so a
custom action isn't needed.

I left a phone on my homescreen because I don't trust myself to realize I
missed a call just with notifications. iTrans is a metro north schedule app
that I check before I leave work because I'm paranoid a schedule has changed
(very healthy, I know).  [Clear](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/clear-tasks-to-do-list/id493136154?mt=8&at=11laRZ&ct=lcpbp) and
[Trello](http://trello.com) organize my work/personal life. (Aside from Jira,
but I have yet to find a good iOS app).  [Check the
weather](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/check-the-weather/id557872119?mt=8&at=11laRZ&ct=lcpbp) has been my weather app of choice
since it came out. It's fast and simple.  At work I need to check my calendar
a lot so [Fantastical
2](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/id718043190?mt=8&at=11laRZ&ct=lcpbp) stays.
I've been trying to force myself to use [Day
One](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/day-one-journal-diary/id421706526?mt=8&at=11laRZ&ct=lcpbp) and [Evernote](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/evernote/id281796108?mt=8&at=11laRZ&ct=lcpbp) a lot more. Having
them on my homescreen has been invaluable.  The last 4
([PocketCasts](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pocket-casts/id414834813?mt=8&at=11laRZ&ct=lcpbp),
[Tweetbot](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/tweetbot-3-for-twitter-iphone/id722294701?mt=8&at=11laRZ&ct=lcpbp),
[Riposte](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/tweetbot-3-for-twitter-iphone/id722294701?mt=8&at=11laRZ&ct=lcpbp), and [Instapaper](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/instapaper/id288545208?mt=8&at=11laRZ&ct=lcpbp)) get opened
multiple times a day on average so they needed to stay.

This is my main screen. From bottom left to top right: Text my wife Apps that
I use to consume things Apps that I use to "do" things Contacts and logging to
Day One Group texting and communication Random things and [adding to

Reading/Listening apps that I just can't live without. Instapaper stayed on
the homscreen. Tried living without it, didn't work. I open that app multiple
times a day.  When I'm in the mood, I use Velocity for speed reading.
[Pushpin](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pushpin-for-pinboard/id548052590?mt=8&at=11laRZ&ct=lcpbp) is a new addition. I'm a fan of
[Pinbook](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pinbook-for-pinboard/id564452716?mt=8&at=11laRZ&ct=lcpbp), but giving this one a try.

I've started playing around with more Actions here. New Day One entry, new
Fantastical reminder, go right to search in Google Maps, go right to search in
[1Password](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/1password-password-manager/id568903335?mt=8&at=11laRZ&ct=lcpbp), new post in
[Buffer](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/buffer-for-twitter-facebook/id490474324?mt=8&at=11laRZ&ct=lcpbp).

Fast ways to text/call/email my family.

Some quick logging that I've been playing with in Day
One![IMG_2104](http://timbroder.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/IMG_2104.png)

This is one of the main things I miss about widgets in android. Quick texting
a contact. This is THE reason I bought LCP when I first got an iPhone. I would
go so far as to say I wouldn't have bought an iPhone without
LCP.![IMG_2105](http://timbroder.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/IMG_2105.png)

Quick work contacts![IMG_2106](http://timbroder.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/IMG_2106.png)
