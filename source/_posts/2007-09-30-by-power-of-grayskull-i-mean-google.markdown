Most of my friends got the reference to the "By the Power of Google" tagline
that I chose to use for gPowered. Being a child of the 80's I had the
privilege to watch some of the greatest cartoons ever created. One of those,
was He-Man where one of the popular lines is "BY THE POWER OF GRAYSKULL." When
I was throwing around taglines with "powered by" (powered by Google), He-Man's
line kept popping into my head and stuck. If you don't know what He-Man is,
check out the short summery from wikipedia.  
  
_The show takes place on the fictional planet of Eternia, a land of magic,
myth and fantasy. The show's lead character is Prince Adam, the young son of
Eternia's rulers, King Randor and Queen Marlena. Prince Adam is a seemingly
cowardly, blond muscleman dressed in a Cote d'Azur chemise. However, Prince
Adam possesses a magic sword, and when he holds it aloft and says the magic
words "By the Power of Grayskull! I have the Power!" he is transformed into
He-Man, the most powerful man in the universe. He-Man is a brave, blond
muscleman in a baldric and loincloth. Together with his close allies, Battle
Cat, Teela, Man-At-Arms and Orko, He-Man uses his powers to defend Eternia
from the evil forces of Skeletor, a tyrannical warlord with a skull for a
face. Skeletor's main goal is to conquer the mysterious fortress of Castle
Grayskull, from which He-Man draws his powers. If he succeeds, Skeletor would
be able to conquer not only Eternia, but the whole universe._

And now for a blast from the past, here is the opening theme complete with the
famous lines.
