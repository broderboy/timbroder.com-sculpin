Dropbox recently raised the cap on it's free tier to 18 gigs. But, you only
get 2 gigs out of the gate. The rest is easy to get, but takes a little leg
work. [![](http://timbroder.com/wp-

"Get free space!" at the top right. Then, do all the Facebook/twitter/social
offers to get free space.

Really bumping up your space involves Google
[Adwords](https://adwords.google.com).Â  You can max out your space by putting
your referral link on Dropbox ads that will show up in Google. How much this
will end up costing you can vary. One of my coworkers spent $7, another $11,
and I spent $19. If you set it up like I show below, you don't even have to
think about it.

Log into AdWords, create a new campaign and copy the below settings: (Click to

After this the campaign should be approved and you are all set. Keep an eye on
it at the end of every day and see if you want to continue it to keep getting
more space
