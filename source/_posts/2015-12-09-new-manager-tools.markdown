*This article leans slightly towards Technology Management but is applicable across disciplines*

You've been a great senior resource, you've lead a team or a project, and you've made the decision, along with your manager to transition to some kind of management role. If you are still thinking about it, or wondering what it will be like, start here: [This 90-Day Plan Turns Engineers into Remarkable Managers](http://firstround.com/review/this-90-day-plan-turns-engineers-into-remarkable-managers/ "This 90-Day Plan Turns Engineers into Remarkable Managers"). This article will give you all of the thought starters your need to decide if management is something you want to pursue. 

Below are some required reading to add to your utility belt. Start taking a read through these, and make sure you block off the appropriate amount of time each week to continue your learning! This list is meant to be a starting point for new managers, not an all inclusive list of manager resources

## Books

* [Managing Right for the First Time](http://www.amazon.com/Managing-Right-First-David-Baker/dp/1605440027?tag=nyen0e-20 "Managing Right for the First Time") - This book is intended as a field guide for first time managers, or for managers who want to begin doing a better job. [David Baker](https://www.recourses.com/ "David Baker") worked closely with 600+ companies and interviewed more than 10,000 employees, then summarized the findings in an interesting and eminently readable form. Read this book and you're likely to understand management and leadership like you never have before, but also learn very practical steps toward becoming a better manager and leader.
* [Getting Things Done: The Art of Stress-Free Productivity](http://www.amazon.com/Getting-Things-Done-Stress-Free-Productivity-ebook/dp/B00KWG9M2E/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0?qid=&sr=&tag=nyen0e-20&_encoding=UTF8 "Getting Things Done: The Art of Stress-Free Productivity") - *Note*: I'm not advocating for using the GTD system. Use what works for you. However, the first half of this book is a **gold mine** for how to think about planning, resources, and managing your own and other's tasks. I personally do use GTD, but the lessons, and the way of thinking that this book opens up is transferable to any system. It got me **thinking** about planning and delegating in different and exciting ways. Read the introduction and I guarantee that you'll see scenarios you recognize and want to scream *"YES, YES I DEAL WITH THIS. I HATE IT! HOW DO I FIX IT?"*
* [The Personal MBA: Master the Art of Business](http://www.amazon.com/The-Personal-MBA-Master-Business/dp/1591845572?tag=nyen0e-20 "The Personal MBA: Master the Art of Business") - This book is, but isn't about MBA. It's a toolkit of how to handle various situations and grow your skill set. It's not meant to be read cover to cover, but peruse the table of contents you'll see things you want to read.
