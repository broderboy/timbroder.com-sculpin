Kevin Rose is filming Diggnation in Brooklyn tonight for [Internet
Week](http://www.internetweekny.com/). It starts at 6 I should be able to get
out of work in time. Anyone else going?  
  
"Diggnation is a weekly video podcast produced by Revision3. It is hosted by
Kevin Rose and Alex Albrecht, who had previously hosted TechTV's The Screen
Savers together. Its main purpose is to discuss the top stories from Digg, the
social bookmarking website developed by Rose and others. The format of the
show usually involves Rose and Albrecht reviewing one or more brands of beer
at the opening of the show, of which they will consume throughout the show,
(steadily getting more and more drunk until they are almost incoherent)
followed by them discussing various Digg stories from the previous week. Both
audio and video versions of the podcast are available from Revision3."
