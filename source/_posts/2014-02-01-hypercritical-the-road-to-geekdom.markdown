> Geekdom is not a club; it’s a destination, open to anyone who wants to put
in the time and effort to travel there. And if someone lacks the opportunity
to get there, we geeks should help in any way we can. Take a new friend to a
meetup or convention. Donate your old games, movies, comics, and toys. Be
welcoming. Sharing your enthusiasm is part of being a geek.

>

> Anyone trying to purposely erect border fences or demanding to see ID upon
entry to the land of Geekdom is missing the point. They have no power over
you. Ignore them and dive headfirst into the things that interest you. Soak up
every experience. Lose yourself in the pursuit of knowledge. When you finally
come up for air, you’ll find that the long road to geekdom no longer stretches
out before you. No one can deny you entry. You’re already home.
