**Get your tweets onto Google Talk!**  
  


[Twitter](http://www.twitter.com): A free social networking and micro-blogging service that allows users to send "updates" (or "tweets"; text-based posts, up to 140 characters long) to the Twitter website, via short message service (SMS), instant messaging, or a third-party application such as Twitterrific or Facebook.  
  


[gTalk](http://www.google.com/talk/): (Google Talk) is a Windows and web-based application for voice over internet (VOIP) and instant messaging, offered by Google. 
  
  


[twitter2gTalk](http://twitter2gtalk.appspot.com/): Takes your current tweet and sets it as your Google Talk status (away) message.  
  


I've been toying with [this](http://blog.gpowered.net/2008/03/update-google-talk-status-with-twitter.html) for a while now.  I really wanted to launch twitter2gTalk as a service that anyone could use.  I had the backend code all done and was dragging my feet writing the django front-end.  I went to a hackathon for [Google AppEngine](code.google.com/appengine/) and converted most of the code to run on that.  You need a Google Account to login, but then again, you need one to use gTalk anyway.   
  


I hope some people will find this cool or useful (some people have been [waiting](http://heavycrag.blogspot.com/2008/05/new-reason-to-tweet.html) for this and already signed up).  Feel free to follow [me](http://twitter.com/broderboy) or [the app](http://twitter.com/twit2gTalk) on twitter for feature updates or [subscribe](http://feeds.feedburner.com/gPpowered) to this blog.
