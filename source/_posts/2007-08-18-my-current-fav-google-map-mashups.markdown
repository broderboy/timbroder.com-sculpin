These are some sites I've found since people have started making Google Map
Mashups either because they are really cool or I use them a lot.  
  
[DiggMap](http://www.bittrees.com/diggmap/) \- Diggs are shown in real-time on
the map for users that have specified their location in their profile.  
  
[Google Maps Batch Geocoder](http://www.wotton.org/map/batchgeo.html)  
  
[Google Offices](http://www.google.com/maps/ms?msa=0&msid=112255436550398488662.00000111d25a08716efa7) \- Shows Google Offices around the world  
  
[Traffic and Weather Maps](http://traffic.poly9.com/) \- Mashes Traffic
conditions, road closings, construction, and weather. Not too useful to me as
I don't have a car anymore but it was when I did ;)  
  
[Walk in a straight line around the world!](http://map.talleye.com/) \- Pick a
spot on the map, then the direction you want to walk in, and the map will show
you all the places you would hit if you walked around the world!  
  
[GypsyMaps](http://www.gypsymaps.com/) \- My all time favorite. Gives
Directions with the NYC subway system. I like it a lot better then
[hopstop](http://www.hopstop.com), it just seems more responsive  
  
[Walk Score](http://www.walkscore.com) \- Put in where you live and find all
the walkable places near you. Great for living in a City and you don't have a
car.  
  
[Google Maps API](http://www.google.com/apis/maps/documentation/index.html) \-
Not a map, but the starting resource for if you want to make a mashup  
  
[Google Maps with a spreadsheet](http://gmaps-samples.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/spreadsheetsmapwizard/makecustommap.htm) \-
Power a Google map from  
  
[StreetViewr](http://streetviewr.com/) \- A collection of funny, interesting,
random photos that people have found with [Google Street View](http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&ie=UTF8&ll=37.09024,-95.712891&spn=47.167389,92.8125&z=4&om=1&layer=c&utm_campaign=en&utm_source=en-ha-na-us-google-svn&utm_medium=ha)  
  
[The EDU Map](http://the-edu-map.com/) \- See places of education for a given
city  
  
[Walk Jog Run](http://www.walkjogrun.net/) \- Share routes with other
runner's. I've found some new, less boring ones using this =)
