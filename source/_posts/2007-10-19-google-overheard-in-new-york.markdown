If you haven't heard about [Overheard in New
York](http://www.overheardinnewyork.com) ( OHNY ), or don't subscribe to it, I
can't recommend it more. It's absolutely hilarious. It's been around for a
while and is constantly updated with a dozen or so quotes a day that people
hear while walking / riding around New York City. You don't have to live in
the city to enjoy it, though you might not get all of the humor. I used
[Google Reader Search](http://gpowered.blogspot.com/2007/09/google-reader-
adds-search-box.html) to go through the feed looking for Google references.
Here are a few, note: there were a lot more but not all were appropriate for
all audiences.  
  
**He's Started Scooping Matt Drudge**  
Female Google suit: How's your son doing?  
Male Google suit: Great! He's 11 months now, and he's starting to get a
personality -- it's great!  
Female Google suit: I'd love to see some pictures sometime!  
Male Google suit: He's got a blog!

**But Which One? Which One?**  
Crazy guy: Can anyone tell me about the Chinese stock market? [Two minutes
later] Can anyone tell me about the Chinese stock market? Come on, people,
that's an easy question!  
Suit, laughing: Here's an easy question for you: How far away is Saturn to
Pluto?  
Crazy guy: That is too easy. Why would you ask me something so easy? The
answer is Google. Google is the answer. The real question is, are there aliens
from Saturn and Pluto on this train right now? And how could you tell the
difference? [Looks around, waits for an answer.] Well, I know, because I'm one
of them! [Crazy guy gets off the train.]

**But We'll Find Out for Sure When the Anime Comes Out**  
Nerd #1: So, was she hot?  
Nerd #2: According to Google Image search, yes.

**She Has Six Months Left to LiveJournal  
** Doctor guy: Okay, we have the chest x-ray and it explains what's going on. See this lesion? It is pretty impressive.  
Patient lady: "Impresssive"? Is that a medical term? Am I gonna have to google
that, too?

**Wednsday One-Liners**  
Sketchy doctor: I Google everything! I treat my patients with Google.

Teen chick on cell: Yeah, it's funny... Google it. Wait, do you guys even have
Google in Florida?

Girl: Google is, like, totally taking over the world!
