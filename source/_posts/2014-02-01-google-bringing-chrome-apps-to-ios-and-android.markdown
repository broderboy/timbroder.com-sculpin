I feel like this should just be called "yet another cross platform mobile solution." I'd like to say this will be crisp, feel native, actually work, or gain traction. Google owning or pushing products/technologies used to mean something. Open social? Reader? I've lost faith in them over the past few years. (And this blog's original name was gPowered) Time will tell but the "best" option IMO is still Titanium. I say that with finger quotes because they all suck.
