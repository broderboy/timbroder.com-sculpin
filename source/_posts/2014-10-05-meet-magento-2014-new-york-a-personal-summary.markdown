Alan Kent, Chief Architect of Magento 2 has a great write up of Meet Magento NY


<blockquote>Tim Broder of Alexander Interactive talked about his use of Vagrant to build standard images, ensuring more consistent development environments for all users. He pointed out you can have a Vagrant container mount a file system from your local laptop so you can use a local IDE while having the files run in a standard Vagrant environment image. In development you may mount it read/write and in production read-only. The idea was to ensure all developers had a consistent supported environment.

Oh, and he mentioned a few times “Vagrant Share” which allows you to share your environment with anyone in the world. This looked really useful when collaborating with clients as you can guarantee they have the same set up as you are using to develop the code.</blockquote>
