As the year starts to wind down, I figure I should start the year off with a
clean inbox.  I try to keep no unread messages in my inbox, instead I tag and
archive.  These past few weeks however, my inbox has gotten a little crazy.  
  
I found this filter to show me all my unread mail that is still in my inbox,
hope it helps someone organize like it did me

Happy Holidays all
