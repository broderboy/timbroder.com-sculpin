> I upgraded to Version 2.4 of ReadKit the other day and found my new
feeds—the ones in the RSS News smart folder—in reverse chronological order. I
could’ve sworn I had them set up the other way in 2.3, so I hunted for a way
to switch the ordering around. It’s not in the or under the menu. You have to
right-click on the RSS News item in the left panel and choose from the popup
menu. That brings up a sheet where you can set the ordering.

Thank god. This was driving me nuts.
