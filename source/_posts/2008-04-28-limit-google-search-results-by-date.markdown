[Tech Recipes](http://www.tech-recipes.com/rx/2860/google_how_to_access_filter_by_date_dropdown_box) goes into how how to restrict Google search results by date: Appending "&as;_qdr=d" to a search will display a drop down that lets you choose how far back in time to search.  
  


A [Greasemonkey script](http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/25684) will also do this for you.  Pretty useful if you are searching about a brand new issue. This would have helped me a lot when I was having a problem with [Hardy](http://blog.gpowered.net/2008/04/fixing-nvidia-8600-gt-on-hardy-heron.html)
