Robert Böhnke wrote a good [piece](http://robb.is/thinking-about/beyond-
uxkit/) on what UXKit could mean for the future of iOS/Mac UI Engineering

> The new Photos for Mac is based on a new private framework in 10.10.3,
UXKit. It is essentially a replica of UIKit, based on top of AppKit.

He also comments on what something like react native could mean for engineers,
and the attitude the community has had around other “non-native” in the past
