[Fight Gone Bad IV](http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/timbroder/~3/PDBIQvyH3rY/):

On Sept 26th I am competing in Fight Gone Bad IV to raise money for Wounded
Warriors and Athletes for a cure.  Fight gone bad is a CrossFit workout scored
by the number of reps.

Description from the [CrossFit website](http://www.crossfit.com/cf-info/faq.html#WOD2)

**4.3. Explain Fight Gone Bad**
    In this workout you move from each of five stations after a minute. This is a five-minute round from which a one-minute break is allowed before repeating. We’ve used this in 3 and 5 round versions. The stations are: 

  1. Wall-ball: 20 pound ball, 10 ft target. (Reps)
  2. Sumo deadlift high-pull: 75 pounds (Reps)
  3. Box Jump: 20″ box (Reps)
  4. Push-press: 75 pounds (Reps)
  5. Row: calories (Calories)

The clock does not reset or stop between exercises. On call of “rotate,” the
athlete/s must move to next station immediately for good score. One point is
given for each rep, except on the rower where each calorie is one point.

If you can, [please donate](http://bit.ly/2N8ifX) to help me support these
initiatives
