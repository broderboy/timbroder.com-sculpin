> We’re often told you need to “make” time, a phrase that rankles me.

Drives me nuts as well. Our days are already packed. "Making time" isn't
making it; it's prioritizing time. If you make time for something, you are
acknowledging that the thing you are making time for has a priority at the
expense of something else.

> That’s why it’s important to know how long something takes, or to break it
down into micro projects. By doing so, you may discover that you can reclaim
time “might” by being more efficient, or by delegating tasks (whether they be
personal or business-related).

This is interesting. I'd be interested in trying it and seeing where all my
time is during the day. (I already track all my work hours. Outside of that) I
would worry about it being consuming though. Then stressing about missed logs.
Maybe
