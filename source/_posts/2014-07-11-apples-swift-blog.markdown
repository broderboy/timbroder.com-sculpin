> This new blog will bring you a behind-the-scenes look into the design of the
Swift language by the engineers who created it, in addition to the latest news
and hints to turn you into a productive Swift programmer.

I LOVE the new, open-er Apple. From the barriers between iOS and OSX coming
down, some Apple devs being more open on twitter and in the dev forums, and
now this [blog](https://developer.apple.com/swift/blog/).

Itâ€™s an amazing time to be using Apple dev tools
