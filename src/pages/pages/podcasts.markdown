I co-host the Show &amp; Tell Cast on the [Tekside][7] network. Every month,&nbsp;I join&nbsp;[Sam Strickland][8] and [Ellyn Mcnamara][9] to share and discuss a film that we each have selected. We cover our favorite classics as well as the latest and greatest. Itâ€™s a fantastic opportunity to expose each other and our friends to great films we may have missed or overlooked.
