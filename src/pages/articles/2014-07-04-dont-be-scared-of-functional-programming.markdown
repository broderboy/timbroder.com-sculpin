This [article](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/07/02/dont-be-scared-of-
functional-programming/) made a LOT of things click for me. I hadn't quite
grasped the concepts of functional programming. (I hadn't really tried to).
It's a little long. But, worth it.

> Functional programming can be daunting, but remember that it isnâ€™t only for
PhDs, data scientists and architecture astronauts. For most of us, the real
benefit of adopting a functional style is that our programs can be broken down
into smaller, simpler pieces that are both more reliable and easier to
understand.
