Or at least to London? A VW bug with a camera attached to the top has been
spotted in London. Could be
[Google](http://maps.google.com/help/maps/streetview/index.html)? Maybe
expanding to areas around their [offices](http://googlified.com/2007is-there-a-google-office-near-you/) in other countries? Nothing has been confirmed yet.  
  
I think this could pick up if Google started going to major Global Cities.
Think about it, you could go site seeing without ever leaving your desk. The
top cities on my list would be London, Tokyo, Paris, Venice, Dublin, and Hong
Kong. I am hopefully going to two of these in the next 6 months (Tokyo and
London) around the holidays. Although, Google might have some [legal hoops](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2007/06/05/google_street_view_legality_in_europe/)
to jump through if they decide to do this.
