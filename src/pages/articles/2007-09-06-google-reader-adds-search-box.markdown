Finally!! No more using Yahoo Pipes to search the feeds!  
  
I'm sitting here waiting for my friend Eli to pick me up from his apartment
for a nice lunch over at dreamworks, glancing over a few feeds (I have a LOT
to catch up on when I get back to NY), and one jumped out at me, the Google
Reader Team has finally added a search box to Google reader.

This box will search all of your feeds! Also included in this release are:  
  
* Ability to hide side navigation (I just tried it, it's very well done)  
* Unread count is now 1,000+ rather then 100+ (this is going to be good for
me when I get back)  
* Forward and Back buttons now have more responsiveness when moving between
folders and feeds  
  
Check out [Google Blog Search](http://blogsearch.google.com/) for more blog
searching.
