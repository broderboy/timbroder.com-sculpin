Basecamp 3 is [coming](https://signalvnoise.com/posts/3955-a-preview-of-whats-new-in-basecamp-3 "coming") and I'm exited. Below are excerpts from Basecamp's preview post on what I'm looking forward to most

> Basecamp won't send you any emails, push notifications, or in-app notifications if it's outside your specified work hours. Live a little! Work Can Wait until you're back at work.


> group chat room for quick discussions

This is cool but it came a little too late. We've been using slack for project based and individual chat. It has a dedicated app that is easy to cmd+tab to. I see campfire in the browser sitting in an unchecked tab and not being useful 

> Show someone you care by clicking the Applause button on any message, comment, document, or answer on any automatic question. They'll get a discrete notification letting them know you appreciated what they said. This is a great way to show your support for someoneâs suggestion, idea, or point of view without also sending a notification to everyone else on the project.


> e.g. What did you work on today or Are you blocked on anything?)

Hmm, I wonder if this could be used for virtual scrum?

> @mentions: Psst!

YES, YES, YES, A MILLION TIMES, YES

> They'll instantly get a notification letting them know they've been mentioned, along with a direct link right back to where you mentioned them


> If you're not in the desktop app

Buhhh wait what? Ok maybe what I said about the tabs and apps above might not apply

> You can bookmark just about anything in Basecamp 3 so you can jump right back to it from anywhere else

This will be handy. Here are always a few key threads I end up digging for. Usually long running threads about key deliverables 

> At the bottom of every project is a timeline of all activity going back to the moment you started the project

I like this if search hadn't been improved. This has a lot easier than scrolling through all the lists looking for something around a certain time

> So you can make a folder and put a photoshop file, a Google doc

👍🏻

> Now you can assign to-dos to multiple people. Now you can set date ranges, not just single due dates. Now you can bulk assign multiple to-dos with a single click. Now you can select multiple to-dos and move them as a group.

😭😭😭

> Now you can save any new message or document as a draft before you publish it


> Basecamp 3 allows you to see all the work you've assigned to other people
