I wrote about my [favorite games of 2014](http://timbroder.com/2015/03/games-i-was-addicted-to-in-2014.html). [Sam](http://www.samuelstrickland.me/blog/2015/7/ios-games-you-need-to-play?utm_content=buffer125bf&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&u) posted his list. You should take a look.

> This is one of my favorite games of all time. It tells a tragic and beautiful story full of fantastical mystery. The world is unlike anything else; creating an amazing blend between high fantasy, music culture, and otherworldly charm. Everything reacts to your touch. It makes you feel like you are a guide and a participant in this story, following the Sythian through her journey as a companion rather than an observer.

This has been on my list of games to try forever. It's not that I balked at the $4.99  price tag. Plenty of the Final Fantasy games I've bought were $15. I didn't like the look of sword and sorcery from the screenshots. But Sam's recent game recommendations to me have been great. I'm currently working on a combination of Final Fantasy 6 and Baldur's Gate. Maybe when I finish one of those

I'll add another vote do Machinarium. After playing through the Room I & II last summer Laura and I looked for another puzzle/adventure game. We landed on Machinarium and have been playing through it together when we have time

I LOVED the original Myst. But replaying it scares me. I survived it. I conquered it. I don't know if I would want to open that back up. 

It's HARD
