Great short read. Remember to value the little wins. Not just the big ones

​

> Celebrate your progress, no matter how small. Don't rob yourself of the collective joy of each of those wins. Enjoy the ride. Work hard, knowing the only reward may be the knowledge of a job well-done, but by celebrating the small wins along the way, you could be motivated to break through to the next level.
