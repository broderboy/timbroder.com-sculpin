Update: Code lives on [GitHub](https://github.com/broderboy/jira-tabs "GitHub")

Ever want to open all the Jiraâ€™s on the screen in new tabs? Jess does, I do,
and you should too! For firefox and chrome we now have the JiraTabs bookmark
button. Go to [this page](http://broderboy.github.io/jira-tabs/ "this page") and drag the link up to your bookmarks bar. Then, whenever you are
on a filter or search view of Jira's, click the button and all the jira's on
your screen will open up in new tabs
