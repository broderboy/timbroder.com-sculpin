Completely off topic, but I had to share. Last Thursday I had the amazing
privilege to play Halo 3 on the Lincoln Center IMAX Screen. It was amazing.
For those of you that don't know, the Lincoln center IMAX screen is
70-something feet tall. The master chief was bigger then me. My buddy who got
the tickets was on line around 6:30, I shower up around 8 or so (they were
only letting the first 200 people play), and we got into the theater around
9pm.  
  
Joe Tung and Luke started off by running through a campaign demo, showing off
the saved video features, and blowing stuff up with Forge. The campaign demo
we saw was 'The Storm' which had never been seen before. They fought through
some baddies but turned off the demo as a gigantic spider mech came on to the
screen, I guess we have to wait a few more days to see the rest of that...  
  
After the demos they let us play some slayer! 8 people at a time in 6 min
rounds, I was #164 so I had to wait a bit, no worries though, seeing the other
games on the giant screen made it worth the wait. When I got to play though,
they only let 6 gamers onto the consoles... why? Joe and Luke had decided to
join the fun! Playing Halo 3 against a producer and developer... super cool!
I, of course, had my ass royally handed to me. I wish I had some photos to
show but the security was pretty tight. In retrospect I should have tried to
take a few on my way out. I had played and had nothing to lose... oh well...  
  
Halo 3 can't come soon enough (and I actually have a 360 now)...
