I unfortunately haven't had time to touch Google reader in almost 2 weeks now,
but just caught on [lifehacker](http://lifehacker.com/398759/the-new-igoogle-gets-full+screen-gmail) that Google is rolling out a new personal homepage.
Some of you may have it enabled by default. If not, head over to
[www.google.com/ig/sandbox](http://www.google.com/ig/sandbox) and sign up to
get into the developer sandbox. If you aren't a developer, fake it. My
favorite addition is definitely full screen Gmail preview, which I can't get
to at work. I wonder how long until they block it....
