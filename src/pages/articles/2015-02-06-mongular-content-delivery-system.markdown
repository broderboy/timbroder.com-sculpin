Mongular is something to keep a close eye on. We’ve had a number of projects
at [work](https://www.alexanderinteractive.com) where we might want something…
other than a CMS. Where content is king and that content is decoupled from the
system using or displaying it.  Other solutions that we’re excited about are
[Prismic](https://prismic.io/) and [Contentful](https://www.contentful.com/).

Systems like this would let us do **whatever** we wanted with the site. Not
being tied to the confines of a particular CMS’ way of doing things could be
freeing. These systems offer much more powerful ways to relate content or
parts of content to each other. Going far beyond just weighted tags.

> What is Mongular?

>

> Mongular is a Content Delivery System (Framework?... not really) built to
take advantage of all the tools available to speed up the delivery of your
content to users, and reduce server load.

>

> Content Delivery System?

>

> Mongular wasn't built to be a Content Management System, even though with
enough development it could probably be built to do just that.

>

> Mongular was built to deliver content in an easy, efficient and extendable
manner. Where developers take it, is up to them.
