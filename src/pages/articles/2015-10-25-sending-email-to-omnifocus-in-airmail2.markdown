[Airmail2](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/airmail-2.5/id918858936?mt=12&at=11laRZ&ct=pro "Airmail2") is my desktop client of choice for Gmail. It keeps the same hotkeys as the web version of gmail and has some good integrations.

In outlook, I use ```^O``` to send an email to [Omnifocus](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/omnifocus-2/id867299399?mt=12&at=11laRZ&ct=pro "Omnifocus"). That workflow also attaches the outlook email to the task for easy reference later. I wanted something similar for gmail besides just forwarding the email to Omnifocus. With that, I still had to go find the email to actually reply to it. Omnifocus integration is the single most important reason (to me) for using Airmail. Airmail will add an in-app link back to the email in Airmail in the notes section of the task.

But, I don't like the default hotkey, I just want it to be ```^O```. To get this to work:

1. Go to Settings.app > Keyboard > Shortcuts
2. Add Airmail2
3. Add an action with the Menu Title of: ```OmniFocus...```
4. Record your keyboard shortcut to be ^O
