*Updated 03/17/2020*

If you are fortunate enough to be able to work from home during the current crisis, your kids may also be home with you. We've been figuring out a handoff schedule, what hours to work; very early and late as needed, and what activities to do with the boys. Ours are 4 and 2. I understand we've very privileged to be in this position but I hope this list of links helps anyone else looking for activities to do
