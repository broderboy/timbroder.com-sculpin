Last week during the presidential debate, the country was a-twitter.  There
were a bunch of sites doing some sort of realtime web 2.0 shows of the debate,
with a lot of these using twitter and hashtags.  If anyone knows of any sites
that I haven't listed below, please let me know  
  
We had the TV, a couple of laptops, and a few bottles of wine going and it
turned out to be great fun.  
  
My favorite site was definitely Current's [Hack the
Debate](http://current.com/topics/88834922_hack_the_debate)  It displays the
video/audio of the debate, as well as real time tweets that are tagged with #current.  This is where I'll be spending most of my time.  
  
Twitter weighs in with [http://election.twitter.com/
](http://election.twitter.com/)  
  
[#tweetdebate](http://www.web-strategist.com/blog/2008/09/21/twitter-presidential-debates-sept-26/) was an experiment to use twitter to track in
real time who is winning, this is tracked using search.twitter.com.  See the
[site](http://www.web-strategist.com/blog/2008/09/21/twitter-presidential-
debates-sept-26/) for rules.
