So I'm sitting here eating lunch and go to see if there is anything new on
Digg. Saw the new layout, looks nice, haven't really had a chance to play
around with it yet. However, when i got to the
[Linux/Unix](http://digg.com/linux_unix) section, it wouldn't show up in
Internet Explorer (6). It works fine in FireFox. Does someone over at Digg
have a sense of humor or is my browser just acting on the bunk?
