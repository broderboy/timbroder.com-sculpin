I love to read. I always have and I probably always will. When people ask me
why I read so much or about how fast I can, I usually attest to the fact that
when I was a child, the household rule was no television on weekdays, so, lots
of books and reading. I still remember the first book I was able to finish on
my own without any help from my mother; The Mouse and the Motorcycle.  
  
A few months ago when I was looking for a service to keep track of all my
books (those I had read and those I wanted), the top two that I had come up
with were [Shelfari](http://www.shelfari.com/) and
[LibraryThing](http://www.librarything.com/). At the time LibraryThing seemed
slow and clunky while Shelfari came off as fairly polished. Note that I really
didn’t spend too much time at either during this initial assessment and that I
ended up going with Shelfari.  
  
Coming back to the present, I still use Shelfari and now that [Google Book
search](http://books.google.com/) has come out with the [“My
Library”](http://books.google.com/googlebooks/mylibrary/) feature, its time to
do an assessment of this decision.  
  
**My Library**  
Launched on September 6th, this is the latest feature of Google Book Search.
Normally I just go to Amazon if I’m looking for a book, but that’s more likely
because that’s what I am used to. Check out my test Library
[here](http://books.google.com/books?as_list=BDYjGJ9gQiI2fwZ2RhK_5ARoUEnPi_37Mmen-Zjyn9rNza5Y7yew&hl=en)

Pros  

  * Search doesn’t always return what I want. Sometimes I had to go find the ISBN and use that
  * Very fast searching
  * Once books are added to the library, you can search the text within those books and get a preview
  * Has List view and cover view. The list view has a link to Add Labels, Write a Review, and More Editions
  * Links to buy the book from Amazon, Barns & Noble, Booksense, or Froogle
  * Can look for the book in a library
  * Reviews from all over the internet (shows 10)
  * References from all over the internet (shows 10)
  * References from other books
  * Links to other editions
  * References from scholarly works
  * Can share list as an RSS feed
  * No need to sign up if you already have a Google account
  * Unlimited books
  
Cons  

  * limited preview, I know other services don’t even offer a preview, but its such a tease
  * The library didn’t seem to be finding good results. I looked up a few books that I know are in the library up the street and it wasn’t finding them.
  * No user reviews
  * Only export format is RSS
  * Can only import by ISBN by typing a list or copy/paste
  * Need a Google account
  
**LibraryThing**  
I had initially been turned off by this one because the UI seemed clunky and
was sluggish when I first tested it out. A lot of this has changed. Check out
my test library [here](http://www.librarything.com/catalog/broderboy)

Pros  

  * If you really like Amazon (me), then using that as the database is a pro
  * Good recommendations. The recommendations were pretty spot on. There are books on the list that I have been meaning to read for a while now (that I have not yet added)
  * Lots of “Find At” (buy) options: Abebooks, Alibris, Amazon, Barnes & Noble, BookFinder, BookSense, Worldcat, and more
  * The size differences and bolding in the tag cloud make it pretty easy to spot trends
  * Reviews by users
  * I love the book swapping links
  * Good rating system (out of 5)
  * Links to related Wikipedia articles
  * Lots of options for blog cloud
  * Can link with other social sites: Facebook, Digg, etc
  
Cons  

  * only searches Amazon of the Library of congress
  * You can only save 200 books. Lame. They charge $10/year or $25/lifetime to store unlimited books
  * The Display styles of A, B, C, D, E are confusing if you don’t go look up what they mean
  * The “click on cover” menu takes a little while to get used to
  * Blog cloud is static
  * Has a lot of social aspects, but no “Friends”

**Shelfari**  
This is the service I originally went with. Check out my main shelf
[here](http://www.shelfari.com/broderboy/shelf)  
  
![](https://lh6.google.com/timothy.broder/RvCD9fREi0I/AAAAAAAAMRI/GZLVbfjMVig/s400/shelfari.jpg?imgdl=1)  
  
Pros  

  * Multiple shelves
  * Friends and groups, seems more social then the other two. (LibraryThing links to social aspects, but doesn’t have them as built in as Shelfari)
  * Quite pretty
  * Member reviews and Amazon reviews (linked separately)
  * Can write notes (different from reviews) about each book or a shelf in general
  
Cons  

  * Requires Flash
  * Can only buy from Amazon
  * Tag cloud doesn’t have enough difference in size
  * Ads at the bottom of each page
  * Has social aspect of friends, but doesn’t reach out to other social sites

All in all I think I may stick with Shelfari. Yes My Library was the fastest
for searching, and did relate the books to the most external sources, but
sometimes it took a little longer to find the book I was looking for in the
list. My searches in Shelfari, while slower always had the book I wanted in
the top 3 results. I really like the recommendation and book swapping features
of LibraryThing. What sold me on Shelfari and continues to do so, is the
multiple shelves. I have a shelf for books I own and have read, a shelf for
books I own but have not read, and a shelf for books I would like to buy. I
just really like breaking it up this way. The only thing that could make this
aspect better, would be if I could like my third list to my Amazon wish list.
