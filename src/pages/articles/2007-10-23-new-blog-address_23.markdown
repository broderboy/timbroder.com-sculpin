After doing quite a bit of reading over at Yaro Starak's [Entrepreneur's
Journey](http://www.entrepreneurs-journey.com/) and Darren Rowse's
[ProBlogger.net](http://problogger.net) I've decided to move gPowered onto my
domain at <http://blog.gpowered.net/>.  
  
Over the coming days/weeks I'll be updating the template on the rest of the
domain to coincide more with the blog, as well as adding the top menu to the
blog. The blog is still powered by blogger and the old address nicely forwards
to the new one, posts included. I also updated the [FeedBurner
feed](http://feeds.feedburner.com/gPpowered) so if you use that to subscribe
you shouldn't have to change anything (although with the forwarding I don't
think it matters, but why risk it). I also set up gpowered.net and
www.gpowered.net to forward to the blog as the main page. Any of my python
examples will be moved from http://gpowered.net to http://gpowered.net/g/. I'm
going to update all of the posts to reflect this.
