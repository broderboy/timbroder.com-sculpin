[Manton Reece](http://www.manton.org/2015/06/we-need-more-bad-ideas.html):

> The essay reminds me of something that always stuck with me reading about legendary Warner Bros. animation director Chuck Jones years ago. He said that when he was young, his father would give him and his siblings essentially unlimited paper to draw on, unused supplies from his business. We all have 100,000 bad drawings in us. The sooner we get through all the bad drawings — in Shawn’s essay, the bad ideas — the sooner we can start producing our best work.

Write your ideas down. Good or bad. They aren't a thing while they just rattle around in your head. 

Get them out: onto paper, Omnifocus, evernote, whatever. This makes them real

Then you can decide what's good or bad
