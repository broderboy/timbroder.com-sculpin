Twitter users on Thursday will, for the first time, be able to [make voice
calls](http://digg.com/d314ZwX) directly to each other through the
microblogging service.  
  
  
Look out, Facebook users: [Here comes voice chat](http://digg.com/d314NzW).  
  
Sometime in the next few weeks, the social network's tens of millions of users
will begin to be able to have high-quality voice conversations, even as its
third-party developers are able to start including voice in their
applications.
