It's really, really easy to put maps onto any site or blog now using [Embedded
Maps](http://google-latlong.blogspot.com/2007/08/youtube-style-embeddable-maps_21.html). I threw this together real quick to demonstrate. This past
weekend I drove up to Syracuse for the New York State fair. A great time if
you have never been. Plenty of fantastic food and drink. I also had to pick up
my old roomie, and using Google Maps new multiple destination feature this was
easy as well.  
  
First stop:
