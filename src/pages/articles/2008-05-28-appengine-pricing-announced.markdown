These look pretty cheap for what you get, and if one of my little apps
actually got popular enough to fall outside of the free range, I'd gladly pay
for it  
  
Free quota to get started: 500MB storage and enough CPU and bandwidth for
about 5 million pageviews per month  
$0.10 - $0.12 per CPU core-hour  
$0.15 - $0.18 per GB-month of storage  
$0.11 - $0.13 per GB outgoing bandwidth  
$0.09 - $0.11 per GB incoming bandwidth  
  
Google I/O started this morning, unhappy I am not there...
