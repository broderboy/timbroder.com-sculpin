A quick rundown on how to share whole folders with friends so they can see
what you are reading, there might be an easier way to do this but this was the
quickest I found  

  1. Click explore
  2. click "View all recommendations"

  4. click Create a bundle

  5. Fill out the form and drag folders or individual feeds.

  6. After this is done you can email the bundle to your friends
