[Information
Week](http://www.informationweek.com/galleries/showImage.jhtml?galleryID=62)
posted some photos of Google's newest data center near The Dalles' dam.
Needless to say, I wouldn't mind access to this baby. Heck, I would want one,
but there is no way I would be able to power it. I'm sure the proximity to the
dam's power station and water supply were key factors in choosing the
location.
