> Marco and Tiff rank their four favorite podcasts (right now)

​This episode of Top Four was great. It did NOTHING to help the number of podcasts that I want to [listen to](http://www.timbroder.com/podcasts-i-listen-to.html ). I already listen to a lot so adding would have to mean removing something if it was for my personal queue. 

​Luckily, it did give Laura and I some great ideas for shows to listen to together in the car. As we get closer to holiday season and start driving around the northeast, these will be a huge help:

* ​[Undisclosed](http://undisclosed-podcast.com/)
* [You Look Nice Today](http://youlooknicetoday.com/)

​[Roderick on the Line](http://www.merlinmann.com/roderick/) sounds like something I'd really enjoy. But, at 178 episodes it's too intimidating. I can only handle [one](http://5by5.tv/b2w) "catch up" show. (Interesting that both of these involve Merlin). If I had more space/time, [Reply All](https://gimletmedia.com/show/reply-all/) would be first up
