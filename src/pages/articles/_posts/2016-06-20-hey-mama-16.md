> We bring our husbands on to discuss #fatherhood, have them share their #igotthis and #idontgotthis moments since becoming dads, and they make recommendations on apps, books and more for soon-to-be or new dads. We tell stories about their early parenting days and as usual, talk about our weeks.

I joined the Hey Mama! podcast for a very special Father's Day episode.

Check it out!
