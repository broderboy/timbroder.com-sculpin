Two words: HELL, YES

> The best way of showcasing this new feature is through code samples. Pretend you have a collection and you want to perform an operation on each of the items:

```php
$invoices->each(function($invoice) {
  $invoice->pay();
});
```
 
> With this new feature you will be able to simplify this into:

```php
$invoices->each->pay();
```
