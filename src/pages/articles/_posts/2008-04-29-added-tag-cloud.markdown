I haven't been to crazy about how Blogger's default tag/label list looks
lately. On some of my shorter posts it was taking up most of the vertical
space on the page. I looked around to see if I could find a more traditional
tag cloud. I found a pretty good (and very easy)
[tutorial](http://phydeaux3.blogspot.com/2006/09/code-for-beta-blogger-label-cloud.html) and just installed it. I have to play with the colors a bit but I
like the way it looks.
