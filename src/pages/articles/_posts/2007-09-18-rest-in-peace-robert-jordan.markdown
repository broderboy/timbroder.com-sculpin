Alas and woes, one of my favorite authors, [Robert
Jordan](http://www.dragonmount.com/RobertJordan/) has passed away. RJ is the
author of the magnificent [The Wheel of
Time](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wheel_of_Time) Series. The series
currently had 11 books plus a prequel. Jordan was feverishly working on the
12th and final book entitled A Memory of Light. My old Roommate
[Kit](http://www.shelfari.com/Kitster) got me into it and though I had
previously tried the series when I was about 10 I didn't get into it, this
time around I instantly fell in love with The Eye of the World (first book). I
put RJ's work on the same level as Tolkien, who is my all time favorite
author. Robert Jordan came to "dominate the world that Tolkien began to reveal
to us." One of the words at the bottom of gpowered.net comes from a reference
to the main character, Rand.  
  
RJ, you gave me a great world to escape this one into. I will miss you dearly.
Rest in Peace and become a Memory of Light.
