I don't know why I never noticed this before but you can subscribe to the mail
sent to Google Groups through an RSS feed at the bottom of each group. I'm
trying it out for a few groups, I might like it better then reading through
the mail. I wonder if there is a way to subscribe to the rolled up versions of
the posts...
