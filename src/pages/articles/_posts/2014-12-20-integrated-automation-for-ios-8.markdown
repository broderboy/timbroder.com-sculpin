I can't wait to play with
[Workflow](https://appsto.re/us/2IzJ2.i&at=11laRZ&ct=LCP) more over the
holidays

> “Workflow – first teased by Ari Weinstein and team in January 2014 – takes
another approach: instead of relying heavily on a specific functionality (such
as text editing) or third-party apps and services (like IFTTT and Dropbox),
Workflow is primarily aimed at automating native iOS apps and features.

>

> Workflow can automate Calendar events and Reminders, it can parse and
extract data from webpages in Safari, and it has full support for Photos and
sharing services. It even works with iCloud Drive and extensions. Workflow’s
first version lacks some obvious features like backup and sync, but what it
does today is an extremely powerful proposition – from both practical and
conceptual standpoints.”
