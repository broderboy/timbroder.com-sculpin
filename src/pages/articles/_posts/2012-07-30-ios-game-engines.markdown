After playing Rovio's new [Amazing Alex](http://teaser.amazingalex.com/) game
for a while, and seeing [this article](http://www.bgr.com/2012/07/30/amazing-alex-sales-app-store/) on BGR this morning, it made me remember some old
success stories that I had read about, and I got to thinking about what it
would take to develop a [game](http://sv.partypoker.com/) for iOS. More just
to see what options were out there than anything else; I know nothing about
game programming. Side note: Amazing Alex is great. If you have ever played
the incredible machine, you'll feel right at home.   

One success story I remember is Ethan Nicholas and iShoot, which made him over $800k. Check out
how he did it, and how to get started with iOS here: [iPhone developer in
eight easy steps](http://www.lookingforiphone.com/2012/05/17/iphone-developer-in-eight-easy-steps/). If he can do it... why not? But, I digress.   ManiacDev
has great lists of both [Open Source](http://maniacdev.com/2009/08/the-open-source-iphone-game-engine-comparison/) and [Commercial
](http://maniacdev.com/2009/09/the-commercial-iphone-game-engine-comparison-3d-and-2d/)graphic engines for iOS. As far as free goes, [cocos2d](http://www.cocos2d-iphone.org/) and [sparrow](http://gamua.com/sparrow/) both jumped out
at me. Sparrow seemed like the fastest ramp-up time and after a quick look at
it's [api](http://wiki.sparrow-framework.org/manual/display_objects), felt
familiar. Without diving too much into the examples, it seems to follow
similar patterns to some of the python/js UI frameworks I've used.
Unfortunately, the [forum](http://forum.sparrow-framework.org/) seems pretty
sparse. Cocos2d, while looking like a steeper learning curve, seems a little
more mature and a much more engaged community. It's forum has 85% more posts
than sparrow, which coming from a busy php/python community, I like to see. As
for commercial engines, after reading about how Infinity Blade was Epic's most
[profitable game ever](http://www.geek.com/articles/mobile/infinity-blade-is-epics-most-profitable-game-20120627/), and seeing that a license would only be
$99, the [Unreal Development Kit For iOS](http://www.udk.com/) is totally the
way I would go.
