[This ](http://developers.facebook.com/news.php?blog=1&story=157)sounds like a
lot of fun, some good presentations (interesting topics and good presenters),
a live [Diggnation](http://revision3.com/diggnation/), and I LOVE London.
Wish I could go  
  
Here's the lineup:  
  
* Mark Zuckerberg - Fireside Chat  
* Kevin Rose - The future of social news  
* Dave Morin - A more social Web with [Facebook
Connect](http://developers.facebook.com/connect.php)  
* Joe Stump - Languages don't scale  
  
To wrap up the conference there will be a live Diggnation on the main stage
(Oct 10). Directly after that will be the wrap up party which is rumored to
have an open bar, but you didn't hear that from me
