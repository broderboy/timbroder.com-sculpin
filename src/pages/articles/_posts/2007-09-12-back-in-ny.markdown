Well as much fun as I had on the West Coast, there's no place like home and
its good to be back. Highlights from my trip include Pike's Market, Tap House,
Microsoft's campus, the Space Needle, and Mount Si in Seattle, and Dreamworks,
Chinatown, and San Fransisco itself. Photos to come as soon as I have time to
upload them to Picasa.  
  
As I [posted](http://gpowered.blogspot.com/2007/09/google-reader-adds-search-box.html) while I was gone, my favorite thing I glanced at in reader was the
fact that Google Reader added a search bar. This is great for me, there are so
many times where I think "what the heck was that article about that thing...".  
  
Quick summery post of things I saw in reader coming up...
