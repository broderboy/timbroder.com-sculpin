I got some time today to listen to this Podcast today on the way to and from
one of our other buildings today uptown. I was attending
[SAS](http://www.sas.com) training which is a pretty cool data mining / report
generation tool.  
  
This episode was an interview with T.V. Raman and his seeing eye dog Hubbell
on accessibility in a developer's world. Quick recap:  
  

  * Why care about accessibility? (As a developer)  

    * You DON'T know your user
    * try to build for the widest range of abilities
  * Think about how people with different abilities will use the app
  * FireFox, Internet Explorer, Safari, Konquerer. Browser specifics are a problem
  * Generic browsers out of the box do not help vision, does not enhance views, or help the motion impaired
  * you have to add on to the browser
  * There is too much "slop", you need to take a step back and not assume what your user will use
  * CSS is good for getting developer / user balance
  * There are very good FireFox accessibility addons
  * Google results page is an html mess so it can work in all browsers
  * The standard GMail interface is an accessibility nightmare but this is remedied by using the mobile version
  * A year from now Ajax accessibility will get much better with FireFox 3
  * **Bottom Lines:**
    * What is it that you are using for accessibility? Is it the base platform? Does it come with tools
    * What is the focus?
    * What platform are you on?
  * Google books scan and OCR to voice is decent
  * The mobile calendar is also good.
