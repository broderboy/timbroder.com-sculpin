This is a quite from a Facebook employee:

> We’re blind. It doesn’t matter what any individual person thinks about
something new. Everything must be tested. It’s feature echolocation: we throw
out an idea, and when the data comes back we look at the numbers. Whatever
goes up, that’s what we do. We are slaves to the numbers. We don’t operate
around innovation. We only optimize. We do what goes up.

There is a flip side to this too, right? Facebook HAS that kind of data. What
I wouldn't DO for that kind of data. Do we have our own custom tracking
(Google Analytics) on our magneto sites at work? Of course. Does it get us the
data we need? Yes and know. We can track conversions, user flows, A/B test
what we need. But, the pixel level knowledge of HOW a user is using the site
that Facebook seems to have seems pretty slick.
