So I really have been digging the Windows 7 beta.  However, Itunes does not
sync podcasts correctly on the 64 bit version.  IF syncing works at all, it
takes a while. I had used winamp to listen to my music a while ago, but had
switched to amarok when I started single booting linux (yes, I hated Vista
that much).  Now that I'm back to using windows a bit, I wanted my podcast
experience to go flawlessly.  
  
As much as I dislike iTunes, they have got podcast management down pat  

  * search for podcast
  * subscribe to podcast
  * download episodes
  * sync with ipod
  * **after an episode has been listened to, delete from computer hard drive**
That last point is the most important part, everything else can be done
manually  
  
All this can be done with winamp. You will need two things, winamp and the
[ml_iPod](http://mlipod.sourceforge.net/?page=downloads) plugin.  While winamp
does come with ipod support built in, ml_iPod has many more features.  The
following steps should get you up to speed on podcasting with winamp  

  * install winamp
  * install the ml_iPod plugin (it will tell you it has to remove the built in ipod plugin, this is ok)
  * set a directory to save the episodes in

  * plug in your ipod
  * enable podcast support for the ipod
  * point it to your episode folder
  * set the query for when to delete old episodes

  * Add your podcasts by searching for them in the directory, or adding them manually using their RSS feed

After this you should be good to go. podcasts!
