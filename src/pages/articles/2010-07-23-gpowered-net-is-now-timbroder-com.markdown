Hi all, some of you may have noticed this site is no longer on the
gpowered.net domain.  I've been wanting to move onto wordpress for a while now
and also do some additional writing beyond code stuffs which would be outside
of the scope of gpowered.  I also unfortunately (or fortunately because I love
my [job](http://www.alexanderinteractive.com/)) don't have as much time as I
used to to research and post how to's.  Heavy django and magento going on
lately, I'll try to post about those. There are two RSS links at the top, RSS
has everything on this site including gpowered.  the gpowered RSS will
continue to contain only tech articles. Let me know of any issues on the new
site
