Vagrant 1.8 is out and it's a huge update. My 3 favorite features are below. Click through above for the full list

> Snapshots are a feature of hypervisors that allow the point-in-time state of a virtual machine to be saved and restored

This is awesome. No more copy disks around or worrying you forgot to back up the DB or git stash!

> New command: port - This will display a list of forwarded ports to the guest machine. This is especially useful if Vagrant is auto-correcting ports in the case of collisions.

​

> New provisioner: ansible_local - This executes Ansible on the guest machine rather than on the host machine.
