This is the start of a really great series. It uses Swift for the examples but everything in the articles holds true for any language/platform

* [Errors: unexpected, composite, non-pure, external](http://www.cocoawithlove.com/blog/2016/03/17/non-pure-errors.html "Errors: unexpected, composite, non-pure, external")

> First, some quick terminology:
> 
> 1. an error condition is a failed conditional check that results in a function skipping its usual functionality and instead returning an nominated error value.
> 
> 2. an error is a value used to report that an error condition occurred and normal functionality was skipped
> 
> 3. error handling is code that looks for errors and performs different actions based on the presence of those errors
> 
> 4. error reporting communicates an error result from a user task to the user
