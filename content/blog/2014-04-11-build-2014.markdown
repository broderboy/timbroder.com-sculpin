[Justin](http://carpeaqua.com/2014/04/07/build-2014/) goes over his experience
at the Microsoft Build conference this year:

> With things like C#, the Roslyn compiler/frameworks, and the modern WinRT
runtime, it feels like Microsoft is way ahead of Apple in the future looking
regard. As a developer, I’m jealous of a lot of the technologies coming out of
Microsoft. As a user? They’ve got a long ways to go before I consider using
Windows over a Mac. That said, this is the new Microsoft. They don’t need me
to use Windows or Windows Phone as long as I use Microsoft services like
Azure, Office 365 and the like.

After following what both he and Brent Simmons have been doing with Azure, I'm
more than a little curious to tinker with it. I've only recently tried
something higher level than AWS, I was a heroku virgin. So, I don't feel I'm
biased. The price wars, as well as a [number](http://carpeaqua.com/2014/03/26/the-parts-of-your-platform/) of [arguments](http://www.marco.org/2014/03/27/web-hosting-for-app-developers) for/[against](http://inessential.com/2014/03/27/on_running_your_own_servers_and_why_we) VPS vs
[higher](http://www.marco.org/2014/03/27/what-did-brent-learn) level have had
this on my kind lately. Mobile Services as a first class citizen on Azure is
interesting. AWS is trying with their push service, but it feels like an
afterthought at the moment.
