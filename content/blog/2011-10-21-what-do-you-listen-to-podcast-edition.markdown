I tend to listen to a decent number of podcasts. Usually while doing the
dishes, running, or something or other in the park.  Some are book/comic
related and help me keep up to date with what's coming out and how some books
were that I didn't have time to read.  Others are tech and help me get other
opinions on the new libraries or trends.  I've found a number of fun libraries
/how-tos from listening. Check them out below, what do you listen to? Tech
