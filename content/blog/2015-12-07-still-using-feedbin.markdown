> Feedbin is under continual development and every few of months there's a new feature released or small improvements made to the user-interface.

I signed up for [Feedbin](https://feedbin.com/ "%fill:name%") and [Feed Weangler](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/feed-wrangler/id634486174?mt=8&at=11laRZ&ct=Wflw6 "%fill:name%") the day they came out. I was a *huge* Google Reader junkie (and had even written add-on modules for it ). I wanted to make sure I had a great service when it finally shut down. I paid for both services for 2 years to fully try them both out. 

I've been more than happy with Feedbin. It gets regular updates,  is super fast, and integrates with all of the apps I use on my phone or Mac. Feed Wrangler had the killer feature of not showing RSS items if you had already loaded them into Instapaper. I wanted this to be enough to keep using it, but unfortunately it wasn't. I love [David Smith](https://mobile.twitter.com/_davidsmith "%fill:name%"), his work, and all he does for the community. But it's obvious that Feed Wrangler isn't his main focus. That's ok! But, I want a product they continually approves beyond security updates
