> If you had to choose between only reading Twitter or only reading weblogs,
which would you choose? Losing Twitter would be a bummer for a lot people, but
losing weblogs would decimate the web. We should do more to strengthen weblogs
and RSS because they are the foundation for so much of the most important
writing on the web.

Joking aside, I do get a lot of my news from twitter these days. I would say
half the articles that I'd be interested in reading (dumping to [Instapaper](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/instapaper/id288545208?mt=8&at=11laRZ&ct=LCP)
from [Reeder](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/reeder-2/id697846300?mt=8&at=11laRZ&ct=LCP) or [Mr. reader](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/mr.-reader/id412874834?mt=8&at=11laRZ&ct=LCP)) I've already added from twitter. Luckily, I use
[Feed Wrangler](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/feed-wrangler/id634486174?mt=8k) so I don't see duplicates of something already in
Instapaper when browsing my feeds.
