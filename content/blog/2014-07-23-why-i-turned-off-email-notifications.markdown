NO EMAIL NOTIFICATIONS. I've been doing this for about a year now on my phone
and it's amazing. I've been doing it for 3 years on my laptop. I don't know
why I didn't do it on all my devices sooner. (I don't get outlook or gmail
notifications). It lowers stress and helps me focus on **actual tasks**
instead of context switching into email all the time. Context switching is
**expensive**

> Reply too fast, expectations are set

No arguments here. If someone thinks you respond to emails within 5 mins, they
will expect it. When you don't, you'll be under delivering.

> If it’s urgent, why are you using email?

This is a **huge** pet peeve of mine. "Did you have a chance to respond to
that email I sent you 30 seconds ago?" drives me nuts. If it's an emergency,
send me an IM. If I'm offline or don't respond, get up off your ass and walk
over. If I'm remote and offline for some reason, text me.
