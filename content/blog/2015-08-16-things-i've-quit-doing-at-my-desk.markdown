​We do do a lot at our desks. It's interesting though how much of "work" has spilled onto our other devices. At least during the day I'm in outlook and Omnifocus on my phone. When I have 1:1s with my directs, I bring my iPad with Omnifocus to review goals or notes I've kept track of

I do my best thinking in the shower at home. I've had sooooo many epiphanies over the years in the shower. Either brand new ideas or some problem that may have had me stumped for days. 

I think it's the sensory deprivation. There's nothing to distract you, your mind is free to wander, and there is plenty of ambient noise. Sing if it helps!
