I was trying very hard to get the next HOWTO online last night. I got it about
3/4 of the way done but then went to bed so I could go to the gym this
morning, but then I ended up setting my alarm for 6pm instead of 6am.... so
that was a waste I probably could have finished it. Tonight I'm going to test
out Halo 3 on the [Lincoln Center Imax Screen](http://www.fandango.com/amcloewslincolnsquare13withimax_aabqi/theaterpage) which should just be crazy. Until
then here's a good article I read yesterday entitled [Will The Google Bashers
Please Shut Up?](http://performancing.com/will-the-google-bashers-please-shut-up)  
  
Till later, I'll see what time I get back tonight...
