Up until the pandemic, I co-hosted 3 podcasts on the [Tekside][7]. Combined, my shows garnered in between 10,000 and 15,000 listeners every month. It was great fun and I hope to be able to do it again some day

* GTDGedi was a show about productivity; the apps, methods, and tools we used to stay organized and move fast in the digital age
* JACKEDcast was about staying physically and mentally healthy, and making a better version of ourselves
* The Show and Tell Cast was a love letter to movies. Every month all the hosts would bring a movie they had seen before and discuss everyone's experience watching it. It let me meet new people and connect with some very old friends

Check out the shows that [I listen to][11]
